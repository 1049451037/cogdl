# Cognitive Graph
Cognitive Graph is a graph representation learning toolkit that allows researchers and developers to train baseline or custom models for node classification, link prediction and other tasks on graphs.
It provides implementations of several models, including:

- Baselines
  - GAT, GCN, ...
- Sparse
